A Sentiment Analysis projects of various tweets in English, Spanish and Chinese using Hidden Markov Models.


### Part 2 : Getting Y sequence by maximum probability of y

On Windows:
````
python ml_hmm_p2.py {path to input data file} {path to training data file} W
````
On MacOS/Linux:
````
python3 ml_hmm_p2.py {path to input data file} {path to training data file} L
````


### Part 3 : Getting optimal Y sequence using the Viterbi algorithm


On Windows:
````
python ml_hmm_p3.py {path to input data file} {path to training data file} W
````
On MacOS/Linux:
````
python3 ml_hmm_p3.py {path to input data file} {path to training data file} L
````


### Part 4 : Getting k-th best Y sequence in Viterbi
On Windows:
````
python ml_hmm_p4.py {k value} {path to input data file} {path to training data file} W
````
On MacOS/Linux:
````
python3 ml_hmm_p4.py {k_value} {path to input data file} {path to training data file} L
````

### Part 5 : Improvement on HMM
On Windows:
````
python ml_hmm_p5.py {path to input data file} {path to training data file} {name of output file} W
````
On MacOS/Linux:
````
python3 ml_hmm_p5.py {path to input data file} {path to training data file} {name of output file} L
````
Do note that the output file will be written in the same directory as the input data.
